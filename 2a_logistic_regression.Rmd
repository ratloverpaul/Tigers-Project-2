```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## load required libaries

```{r}
# Loading the caret library, which provides tools for training and evaluating the logistic regression model
library(caret)
```


## get and clean data

```{r}
# Reading in the cleaned dataset
book <- read.csv("cleaned.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

# Removing unnecessary columns: 'X' (index column) and 'reservation_year' (deemed irrelevant for prediction)
book$X <- NULL
book$reservation_year <- NULL

# Converting 'reservation_day' and 'reservation_month' into factors for modeling, as they represent categorical data
book$reservation_day <- as.factor(book$reservation_day)
book$reservation_month <- as.factor(book$reservation_month)
```

## split and train data

```{r, cache = TRUE}
# Creating a 70:30 train-test split to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data
split_size <- .3  # Proportion of data to use for testing
test_size <- split_size * nrow(book)  # Calculate the number of rows for the test set
set.seed(1234)  # Setting seed for reproducibility
test_rows <- sample(1:nrow(book), test_size)  # Randomly sample row indices for the test set

# Splitting the dataset into training and test sets
book_test <- book[test_rows, ]  # Test set
book_train <- book[-test_rows, ]  # Training set
```

## build model

```{r, cache = TRUE}
# Building a logistic regression model to predict 'booking.status' using all other features
# Includes interaction terms for specific feature pairs to capture more complex relationships
m_regression <- glm(booking.status ~ . + number.of.adults*number.of.children + 
                      number.of.adults*average.price + 
                      average.price*number.of.weekend.nights + 
                      car.parking.space*number.of.children + 
                      number.of.adults*reservation_month + 
                      average.price*reservation_month, 
                    data = book_train, family = "binomial")

# Displaying a summary of the model to review coefficients and statistical significance
summary(m_regression)

# Using backward stepwise selection to simplify the model by removing less significant predictors
step_model <- step(m_regression, direction = "backward",trace = F)

# Displaying a summary of the refined model
summary(step_model)
```

## predict and evaluate model

```{r, cache = TRUE}
# Generating predictions for the test set using the refined logistic regression model
p_regression <- predict(step_model, book_test, type = "response")

# Summarizing the prediction probabilities to review their range and distribution
summary(p_regression)

# Converting predicted probabilities into binary outcomes (1 for predicted cancellations, 0 otherwise)
p_regression_bin <- ifelse(p_regression > .5, 1, 0)

# Evaluating the model's performance using a confusion matrix
# This calculates metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity
confusionMatrix(as.factor(p_regression_bin), as.factor(book_test$booking.status), positive = "1")
```

## export predictions

```{r}
# Exporting the prediction probabilities to a CSV file for further analysis or reporting
write.csv(p_regression, "prediction_logistic_regression.csv")
```
